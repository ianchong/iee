          <p>For many years, both HKUST and SKKU have researched and developed innovative ways of tackling the challenge of providing effective and high-quality engineering education to meet the future demands of the world. In this symposium, experts have been invited to provide their insight on the future of engineering education, and how both proven and innovative teaching methods can provide for a more effective learning experience for students.</p>
          <div style="height: 3vh;"></div>
          <p>At the conclusion of the symposium, students participating in the HKUST x SKKU Intercultural Peer Learning Program (IPLP) 2021 will present design solutions to challenges imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic on their university learning experience. Students from Hong Kong and Korea will team up and take advantage of 3D modelling software to illustrate their designs.</p>

          <h4>Abstract</h4>
          <p id="abstract">Five major shifts in the past 100 years of engineering education were identified in the 2012 Centennial Special Issue of the Proceedings of the IEEE. They are summarized and lessons learned and implications for the current shift, the shift to remote instruction are described. This keynote focuses of what we have learned from previous shifts, especially Shift 5:  applying education, learning, and social-behavioral sciences research; and the implications for advancing learning during the pandemic. Three key areas are emphasized, (1) what we know about how people learn and (2) the importance of intentional course design, and (3) the importance of interactive learning. The speaker has been active in engineering education research since the early 1970s and played a major role in the development of the first engineering education PhD granting department. </p>

This keynote focuses of what we have learned from previous shifts, especially Shift 5:  applying education, learning, and social-behavioral sciences research; and the implications for advancing learning during the pandemic. Three key areas are emphasized, (1) what we know about how people learn and (2) the importance of intentional course design, and (3) the importance of interactive learning.

        document.getElementById("abstract").innerHTML="In the past decade, Korea's higher education has experienced a huge paradigm shift owing to dramatic environmental changes. The new trend adopts student-oriented education, student engagement, and student success as major themes. These terms are widely used in the official reports and statements from higher education institutions and the government. The most frequently cited concept is &ldquo;student-oriented&rdquo; education. It is perceived as the vison which universities and colleges must pursue for their sustainable development. In other words, universities and colleges should work toward satisfying the needs of students, helping them fulfil their academic and career goals, and ultimately helping them grow up as better human being. In recent years, the term &ldquo;student engagement&rdquo; was introduced to actualize the theme of &ldquo;student-oriented&rdquo; which may be viewed solely as abstract and directional. While &ldquo;student-oriented&rdquo; suggests the ideal that institutions should strive for, &ldquo;student engagement&rdquo; involves the intervention strategies that are prescribed for developing systems and practices aimed at building student-oriented institutions. Finally, &ldquo;student success&rdquo; as a theme is surprisingly flourishing among Korean universities and colleges which have made it their fundamental mission to be accountable for the students' learning outcomes and success in future life. Moreover, student engagement is highlighted as an effective strategy to achieve student success.<br>Professor Bae presents a case of Sungkyunkwan University, which officially proposed student engagement and success as a vison of the institution. Currently the SKKU student success system is widely considered a successful and exemplary case of university innovation in Korea. He will present what SKKU has done to promote student engagement and succuss and share lessons from SKKU case.";

Engineering Education has expanded beyond traditional engineering disciplines and has established itself as a discipline. In response to the national need for long-term and engineering education reform, a number of Departments of Engineering Education and degree programs in Engineering Education have been established. These programs and their graduates have become the pipeline for educating future engineering faculty and professionals interested in pursuing careers in K-12 teaching and administration. The Department of Engineering Education at the University of Florida (UF) was established in 2019. Herein, I present the vision and framework that formed the basis of the newest department in the Herbert Wertheim College of Engineering at UF.
