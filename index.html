			<h3>Abstract</h3>
			<p id="abstract">Five major shifts in the past 100 years of engineering education were identified in the 2012 Centennial Special Issue of the Proceedings of the IEEE. They are summarized and lessons learned and implications for the current shift, the shift to remote instruction are described. This keynote focuses of what we have learned from previous shifts, especially Shift 5:  applying education, learning, and social-behavioral sciences research; and the implications for advancing learning during the pandemic. Three key areas are emphasized, (1) what we know about how people learn and (2) the importance of intentional course design, and (3) the importance of interactive learning. The speaker has been active in engineering education research since the early 1970s and played a major role in the development of the first engineering education PhD granting department. </p>

		document.getElementById("abstract").innerHTML="In the past decade, Korea’s higher education has experienced a huge paradigm shift owing to dramatic environmental changes. The new trend adopts student-oriented education, student engagement, and student success as major themes. These terms are widely used in the official reports and statements from higher education institutions and the government. The most frequently cited concept is “student-oriented” education. It is perceived as the vison which universities and colleges must pursue for their sustainable development. In other words, universities and colleges should work toward satisfying the needs of students, helping them fulfil their academic and career goals, and ultimately helping them grow up as better human being. In recent years, the term “student engagement” was introduced to actualize the theme of “student-oriented” which may be viewed solely as abstract and directional. While “student-oriented” suggests the ideal that institutions should strive for, “student engagement” involves the intervention strategies that are prescribed for developing systems and practices aimed at building student-oriented institutions. Finally, “student success” as a theme is surprisingly flourishing among Korean universities and colleges which have made it their fundamental mission to be accountable for the students’ learning outcomes and success in future life. Moreover, student engagement is highlighted as an effective strategy to achieve student success.<br>Professor Bae presents a case of Sungkyunkwan University, which officially proposed student engagement and success as a vison of the institution. Currently the SKKU student success system is widely considered a successful and exemplary case of university innovation in Korea. He will present what SKKU has done to promote student engagement and succuss and share lessons from SKKU case.";

Before joining in the faculty, he served as Assistant Secretary to the President for Education in the Office of the President. Professor Bae also has sixteen-year experience in the Korean Ministry of Education. He has held positions in various parts of the Ministry, including Director in the International Cooperation Team and in the After-school Policy Planning Team. He completed both Ph. D. and MS degree in Workforce Education and Development (WFED) from the Pennsylvania State University (PSU) in 2006 and 2004, respectively and earned a BA in Ethics Education from the Seoul National University in Korea. His current research interests focus on education reform policy, student success in higher education, and human resources development (HRD) at the national level. His recent publications appear in many internationally recognized journals including Asia Pacific Education Review and Quality Assurance in Education.";
